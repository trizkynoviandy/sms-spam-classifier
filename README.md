# Email Spam Classification

This project is a Python implementation of an email spam classification system.
The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify emails as either spam or not spam.

The project uses the scikit-learn library to train and evaluate the model.
The dataset can be obtained from [here](https://github.com/SmallLion/Python-Projects/blob/main/Spam-detection/spam.csv),
which contains a collection of emails with labels indicating whether they are spam or not spam.
